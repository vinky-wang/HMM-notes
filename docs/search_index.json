[["appendix.html", "Chapter 9 Appendix References", " Chapter 9 Appendix An intuitive and less laborious way to establish properties of the HMM is to invoke properties of directed graphical models. In a directed graphical model, the probability of a set of random variables \\(\\{V_1, V_2, \\dots, V_n\\}\\) can be factored into a product of conditional probabilities, one for each parent (node) \\(\\text{pa} (V_i)\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\Pr(V_1, V_2, \\dots, V_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\Pr(V_i| \\text{pa} (V_i)) \\tag{9.1} \\end{equation}\\] In the case of HMMs, \\(C_1\\) has no parents \\(\\text{pa} (X_k) = C_k \\qquad{\\text{for } k = 2, 3, \\dots}\\) \\(\\text{pa} (C_k) = C_{k-1} \\qquad{\\text{for } k = 2, 3, \\dots}\\) Then the joint distribution of \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^{(t)}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{C}^{(t)}\\) is given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\Pr(\\boldsymbol{X}^{(t)}, \\boldsymbol{C}^{(t)}) = \\Pr(C_1) \\prod_{k=2}^t \\Pr(C_k|C_{k-1}) \\prod_{k=1}^t \\Pr(X_k|C_k) \\tag{9.2} \\end{equation}\\] References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
